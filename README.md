The Furious Fowl project lovingly rips off the popular game Angry Birds using a slingshot and Rethink Robotic's high performance collaborative robot, Sawyer.  

Furious Fowl works by using an OpenCV-based vision system to detect colorful objects in the playing field. The coordinates of the colorspaces are passed to our functions that calculate needed trajectory to hit the best target, chosen by our cost function. We then manipulate the arm accordingly by using tools in from the Intera Motion Interface library.  

This project was designed, built, tested, and enjoyed by Zander Louie, David Doan, George Allison, Ash Choski, and Pierce Doogan, under Bradley Hayes' Introduction to Robotics class at the University of Colorado Boulder Fall 2018.
